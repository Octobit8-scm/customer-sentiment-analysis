# customer-sentiment-analysis
## Implementation Steps
This section outlines the process of analyzing customer sentiment using data from reviews, social media, or other textual sources.
### 1. Data Collection
#### Objective: 
 - Gather textual data reflecting customer opinions and sentiments.
#### Explanation: 
 - Scrape data from sources such as customer reviews on websites or social media posts.
#### Tools:
 - BeautifulSoup: Extract data from web pages.
 - Twitter API: Access tweets for sentiment analysis.
### 2. Text Preprocessing
#### Objective: 
 - Prepare raw text for analysis by cleaning and standardizing it.
#### Explanation:
 - Tokenize text into words or phrases.
 - Remove stop words (common words like "and" or "the").
 - Apply stemming (reducing words to their base forms) or lemmatization (grouping words by their root meaning).
#### Tools:
 - NLTK: A suite of libraries for natural language processing.
 - SpaCy: Efficient NLP library for tokenization and lemmatization.
### 3. Sentiment Analysis
#### Objective: 
 - Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the text.
#### Explanation: Use pre-trained models or APIs for sentiment classification:
 - BERT, GPT: Advanced deep learning models for contextual sentiment understanding.
 - Cloud services provide pre-built sentiment analysis capabilities.
#### Tools:
 - AWS Comprehend: Analyze text for sentiment and other attributes.
 - Google Natural Language API: Perform sentiment and entity analysis.
### 4. Dashboard Creation
#### Objective: 
 - Visualize sentiment results for insights and reporting.
#### Explanation: 
 - Summarize analysis outcomes in dashboards with charts and metrics for better decision-making.
#### Tools:
 - Tableau: Create interactive and shareable dashboards.
 - Power BI: Integrate sentiment data into comprehensive business reports.
 - AWS QuickSight: Visualize data stored in AWS environments.
## Key Techniques
#### 1.	Feature Extraction:
 - Bag-of-Words (BoW): Represents text data as word frequency counts.
 - TF-IDF: Highlights important words by considering their frequency across documents.
#### 2.	Deep Learning:
 - Transformers (BERT, GPT): Leverage context and sequence information for advanced sentiment understanding.
